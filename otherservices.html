          <h2 class="section-heading"><center>Other Products Offered</center></h2><br>
          <p class="text-muted">Below we have outlined a few the other products we offer in addition to our cleaning services here at MP Professional Duct Cleaning.</p> 
          <br><h3 class="sub-heading">HEPA Filter Installation</h3>
          <p class="text-muted">We are sure you’ve probably heard a lot about HEPA filters over the last couple of decades. Even if you are not familiar with their use in HVAC systems, vents, and ducts, you may be familiar with their use in vacuum cleaners and other appliances like that.</p> 
          <p class="text-muted">They are popular and spoken a lot for some very good reasons, but if you are new to the world of air purification, we realize that you might need more convincing than that to invest in one.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">At MP Professional Duct Cleaning we offer HEPA filter installation as part of our extensive list of services. Before you decide whether you want or need the benefit of HEPA filters, let’s break down what they are and why they are so important.</p>
          <br><h3 class="sub-heading">What are HEPA Filters?</h3>
          <p class="text-muted">HEPA stands for High-Efficiency Particulate Air and is used to describe special filters that are designed to catch and contain contaminants the first time around. They are especially important in hospitals and other medical care environments where sanitation is extremely important.</p> 
          <p class="text-muted">They can be, and in our opinion should be used in the home environment too. As they offer such benefits as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p class="text-muted">99.97% air filtration</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-muted">Fresh air constantly circulated throughout your home</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-muted">Next to no accumulation or build-up of dust, making blockages more or less a thing of the past</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-muted">Which in turn means duct cleaning is required less frequently</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-muted">And it is more energy efficient as airflow is unrestricted</p></li>
          </ul>
          <br><h3 class="sub-heading">Major Health Benefits of HEPA Filter Installation</h3>
          <p class="text-muted">As well as the more general benefits listed above, there are also several health benefits to having HEPA filters installed in your home, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p class="text-muted">Reduction of airborne allergens, ideal for asthmatics and other allergy sufferers</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-muted">Improved quality of air can help people with other respiratory issues</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-muted">Improved heart rate and blood pressure</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-muted">Reduces the harmful effects of pollution</p></li>
          </ul>
          <br><h3 class="sub-heading">Why Choose Our HEPA Filter Installation Service?</h3>
          <p class="text-muted">Now you know why you should consider having a HEPA filter installed in your property, why should you choose MP Professional Duct Cleaning to carry out the work for you?</p>
          <p class="text-muted">That’s a very sensible and justified question.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">We feel strongly that because we are passionate about delivering a service where you, the customer is our main priority, coupled with the fact that we have more than 6 years’ worth of experience in the industry, that we are the best people for the job of installing your HEPA filter.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">We won’t just install the HEPA filter for you, though, as we will also help you to make the right choice for your home and budget. We carry many different makes and models. You can be sure, though, that although they may have different pros and cons, we have only selected the makes and models that we think are the best out there.</p>
          <br><h3 class="sub-heading">Humidifier Installation</h3>
          <p class="text-muted">Although adding moisture to a room would seem to be counterintuitive and something that most people want to avoid, there are certain scenarios, it needs to be balanced. Therefore, rooms should not be completely dry or completely wet, which means if you have rooms in your property where the air and atmosphere are very dry, you could benefit from the installation of a humidifier.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">Perhaps you are only familiar with humidifiers by name and not by purpose or function. Let us elaborate on why you should consider the humidifier installation service we offer here at MP Professional Duct Cleaning.</p>
          <br><h3 class="sub-heading">What is a Humidifier?</h3>
          <p class="text-muted">A humidifier is a special invention, normally in the form of an electrical appliance that increases the amount of moisture in either a whole building or specific rooms.</p>
          <br><h3 class="sub-heading">Humidifier Health Benefits</h3>
          <p class="text-muted">There are some key health benefits you can gain from having a humidifier installed in your home or business premises, including the fact it eases the symptoms of people who:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p class="text-muted">Have respiratory issues</p></li> 
            <li><p class="text-muted">Regular nose bleeds</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-muted">Dry cough and/or dry throat</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-muted">In addition to the health benefits listed above, it’s also worth noting that if there is a lot of paint on the surfaces in your property, a humidifier can help it last longer. Paintwork tends to crack more easily in areas where there is limited or no moisture in the air.</p>
          <br><h3 class="sub-heading">Why Choose MP Professional Duct Cleaning?</h3>
          <p class="text-muted">If you are interested in having a humidifier installed in your home or property, then we can sort that for you. As well as offering recommendations to the best make and model for your property size and your budget, we will also carry out the installation to the same impeccably high standards we carry out all the work we do.</p>
