          <h3 class="top-bottom-padding">Quality Comes First</h3>
          <p class="add-small-bot-pad">When it comes to hiring a reliable and effective duct cleaning comany that has the experience and skills, we hope our team here at MP Professional Air Duct Cleaning is one you will consider first. We have maintained a sterling reputation in the industry since our company was established 6 years ago and part of the reason, we believe, is because of our strong company mission statement and overall work ethic.
          <p class="add-small-bot-pad">We don’t believe in just finishing a job. Quality, for us, is always a top priority, because we know that’s what our customers expect. After all why would you pay for anything less than the best.</p>
          <p>The success of our company rests on the experience our customers have and whether it’s a good one or not. That is why we will always ensure we have completed a job fully to the satisfaction of our customers.</p>

        <div id="Paris" class="tabcontent text-muted">
          <h3 class="top-bottom-padding">90-Day Money-Back Guarantee</h3>
          <p>There is no point in just using saying something. Particularly with new customers who have never used our services before, we know we need to show we are serious about our commitment to quality service. That’s why we offer a full 90-days money-back guarantee on all work we provide if for whatever reason a customer is not happy with the results of our cleaning services.</p> 
        </div>

        <div id="Tokyo" class="tabcontent text-muted">
          <h3 class="top-bottom-padding">Clean, Safe and Sanitary Work Environment</h3>
          <p class="add-small-bot-pad">More than ever before, we are aware, like companies and organizations across sectors, just how important health, safety, and hygiene is. Since the COVID-19 pandemic took a firm grip on the world, things have changed and there is a strong emphasis on not just making sure the work we carry out is safe and hygiene-conscious, but also the before and after work.</p>
          <p>We equipped ourselves with the best and most effective PPE and always ensure that we treat your home or professional property with the respect and care it deserves. The areas we work in while cleaning your ductwork will always be left in the same condition we found them in. Not cleaning up after ourselves, in our opinion, would mean a job half done and that’s not right at all.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="test1" class="tabcontent text-muted">
          <h3 class="top-bottom-padding">Strong Customer Reviews and Testimonials</h3>
          <p class="add-small-bot-pad">As a customer-driven company, we are determined to deliver an experience for our customers that not only meets but exceeds their expectations. Our strong customer reviews and testimonials  are evidence of that. We are proud to say that we’ve yet to have a customer whom we’ve worked with, providing a cleaning service for the ducts and all associated appliances and fixtures, who was not delighted with the quality.</p>
          <p>Not only that but because we do not see each individual customer as being a one-off, we are always looking for ways to foster and maintain a long-lasting business relationship. We want all new customers to become regular customers.</p>

          <h3 class="top-bottom-padding">Business Growth from Referrals and Our Reviews</h3>
          <p>In the modern-day and age, we live in, we think our customers, new and existing, deserve more than annoying cold callers and telemarking. We have made a point, therefore, from the very beginning, not to use those kinds of tactics to promote our services or to get business. Our strong and effective customer referrals program, customer reviews and testimonials, and the evidence of our past work are all we need.</p>
