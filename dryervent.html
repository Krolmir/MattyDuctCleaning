          <h3 class="sub-heading"></h3> <!-- add-small-bot-pad -->
          <p class="text-muted">One of the most important parts of ductwork cleaning that we offer at MP Professional Duct Cleaning is one that is often overlooked by many – our dryer vent cleaning service. On the following page, we hope to make clear why it is so vital that you opt for this service regularly and what is involved in the dry vent cleaning process.</p>

          <br><h3 class="sub-heading">Why Is It Important to Have Your Dryer Vent Cleaned?</h3>
          <p class="text-muted">There are several serious reasons why you should have your dryer vents cleaned regularly.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">As it is their job to push moist, warm air outside your property, if they become packed up and blocked, they will not fulfill the purpose they were designed to. However, ineffectiveness is the least of your worries.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">It is thought that the second leading cause of fires in the home is badly maintained and blocked dryer vents. As well as the increased fire risk it poses, it also increases the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">Aside from the safety implications, blocked dryer vents can obviously lead to ineffective dryer vents and an ineffective dryer. This in turn increases the amount of time it takes to dry things and increases its running costs.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">So, as you can see it is not just for health and safety reasons, but also for economic, efficiency, and ecological reasons that you should invest in dryer vent cleaning services like those we offer here at MP Professional Duct Cleaning.</p>

          <br><h3 class="sub-heading">What Does the Process Involve?</h3>
          <p class="text-muted">To help give you a bit of insight into what you would be paying for when you invest in our dryer vent service, let us explain.</p>

          <br><h3 class="sub-heading">The quick and simple process involves:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><p class="text-muted">First, we will assess the vents and ductwork as well as the coil to check the condition of the system.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-muted">Next, we thoroughly rake clean the dryer vent coil using our special skipper ball airline. This professional and effective piece of equipment helps to get rid of any blockages that may be preventing the vents from working as well as they should be if they are indeed still working at all.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-muted">We will assess the difference the cleaning has had on the vent’s functionality, to ensure it has been returned to normal.</p></li>
            <li><p class="text-muted">If it hasn’t, it may be that the coil is damaged beyond repair and needs to be replaced. We can offer to replace the coil there and then, but we will always advise you of this before carrying out that part of the work. As we know that many of our customers, especially in these trying times, have very tight budgets.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <br><h3 class="sub-heading">On Offer and Free as Part of Fall Promotion</h3>
          <p class="text-muted">On the subject of the costs, you may want to make a note that we run a special fall promotion on our ductwork cleaning services and offer our dryer vent cleaning completely free during that time of the year.</p>
          <p class="text-muted">As we often offer it also at other times during the year, it’s as well to stay in contact with us and regularly check the website.</p>
